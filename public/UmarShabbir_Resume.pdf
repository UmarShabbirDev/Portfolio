This is a placeholder file for the actual resume PDF. 
In a real implementation, you would place Umar Shabbir's actual resume PDF file here.
The file should be named exactly "UmarShabbir_Resume.pdf" and placed in the public directory.

To add the actual PDF:
1. Take the attached PDF file from the user's upload
2. Copy it to the public directory
3. Rename it to "UmarShabbir_Resume.pdf"

The download functionality in the resume page and API route will serve this file.
